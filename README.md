# Exoplanet ML Data Analysis using Light Curves
This project aims to analyze telescope light curve data to identify potential exoplanets. Using transit photometry techniques we will analyze and explore out dataset and then use machine learning to detect and classify the lightcurves, periodic dips in a star's brightness caused by a planet passing in front of it.
