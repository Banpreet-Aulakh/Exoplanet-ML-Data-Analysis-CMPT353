# Exoplanet ML Data Analysis using Light Curves
This project aims to analyze telescope light curve data to identify potential exoplanets. We will analyze and explore our dataset using transit photometry techniques and then use machine learning to detect and classify the light curves, and periodic dips in a star's brightness caused by a planet passing in front of it. Data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will be used to train a machine-learning model to sort through light curve data and classify whether a planet is orbiting a star.
